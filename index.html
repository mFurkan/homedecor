<h2 id="diy-home-decorating-tips">## 11 DIY Home Decorating Tips</h2>
<h3 id="at-the-front-door-set-the-tone">1. At The Front Door, Set The Tone</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9pKMkId3FsjbkFsrNR9FivP95Ug=/0x0:500x600/920x0/filters:focal%280x0:500x600%29:format%28webp%29:no_upscale%28%29/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19514269/02_foolproof_decor.jpg" alt="enter image description here"><br>
If you want to make a major first impression on your home, paint a cool, glossy hue at the front door. “Red is a good color in many cultures,” says New Jersey-based stager Lara Allen-Brett. A red door in early America meant “welcome” to weary travelers and it represents a safe haven on churches.</p>
<p>Two other hues gaining favor: orange and yellow, according to San Francisco-based stager Christopher Breining. Both colors come in tandem with happiness and fire. One thing that should go: an old-fashioned screen door. Get rid of it or substitute it with a full-length glass storm door that can be turned off for a screened window.</p>
<h3 id="dark-and-neutral-color-wall-colours">2. Dark and neutral Color Wall Colours</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Kw7ol86byJUWSS99Its0zMrrhHk=/0x0:450x600/920x0/filters:focal%280x0:450x600%29:format%28webp%29:no_upscale%28%29/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19514321/03_foolproof_decor.jpg" alt="enter image description here"><br>
Stick to colors such as beige or gray, especially in the first floor where flow is significant. “You want abrupt transitions to be minimised,” Breining says. Neutral walls give you the greatest versatility in the decoration, allowing you to move accessories easily.</p>
<p>And if you have two small rooms next to each other, they feel bigger by painting them the same neutral colour. Look at a paint line, and shift a hue or two up or down for a slight difference from room to room, Allen-Brett suggests.</p>
<h3 id="living-area-make-sure-your-chairs-are-talking-to-your-sofa">3. Living Area: Make sure your chairs are talking to your sofa</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uhL1caLczpjKOLy5DRj4ua0BRSE=/0x0:600x600/920x0/filters:focal%280x0:600x600%29:format%28webp%29:no_upscale%28%29/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19514352/04_foolproof_decor.jpg" alt="enter image description here"><br>
Think of a lovely hotel lobby: The furniture is arranged in groupings that invite you to talk. Aim for a similar sense of harmony and intimacy when putting the furniture in your living room.</p>
<p>“It’s best to have a U-shaped seating room, with a sofa and two chairs facing each other at the end of the coffee table, or an H-shaped sofa directly across from two chairs and a coffee table in the centre,” says Michelle Lynne, a Dallas stager.</p>
<p>One common error to avoid: pressing all the furniture against the walls. “People do it because they believe it would make their space look larger, but in fact it makes the room feel smaller by floating the furniture away from the walls,” she says.</p>
<h3 id="in-your-kitchen-let-the-sun-shine">4. In your kitchen, let the sun shine</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nL9F8OYm3oyE3LaAM9bplsoVOQw=/0x0:500x600/920x0/filters:focal%280x0:500x600%29:format%28webp%29:no_upscale%28%29/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19514381/03_order_house_0.jpg" alt="enter image description here"><br>
“A bare bank of windows is easier when it comes to thick, ancient drapes than an ugly one,” says Lynne. Ideally, dressings for windows should be functional and elegant: think sheers coupled with panels of full length.</p>
<p>If you get a lot of sun in your room, opt for light colors that won’t fade. Cotton, linen, and silk blends are the most recommended lightweight fabrics for panels, because they tend to hang well.</p>
<h3 id="hang-in-every-room-at-least-one-mirror">5. Hang in every room at Least One Mirror</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3y-XVRaaKGMMFk_iqKPQb6NLdi0=/0x0:600x400/920x0/filters:focal%280x0:600x400%29:format%28webp%29:no_upscale%28%29/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19514410/06_foolproof_decor.jpg" alt="enter image description here"><br>
“Mirrors can make a space feel brighter because the light bounces around the room,” Breining says. Yet putting one in the wrong place can be just as awful as not getting one at all.</p>
<p>Put mirrors perpendicular to windows on walls, not straight across from them. Hanging a mirror straight in front of a window can actually bounce the light right out of the window.</p>
<h3 id="scale-up-to-the-wall">6. Scale Up to The Wall</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GjmS43zEK_qFhQjTB02j4HznIJ4=/0x0:400x600/920x0/filters:focal%280x0:400x600%29:format%28webp%29:no_upscale%28%29/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19514442/07_foolproof_decor.jpg" alt="enter image description here"><br>
“There are few items that look more silly than putting dinky little art too high up on the wall,” Breining says. The center of a photograph should hang at eye level. If one person is short and the other is tall, their heights average.</p>
<p>Taking into account also scale; go big with one oversize piece for a large wall, or group smaller gallery-style pieces. Don’t place the pictures too far apart for the latter; typically 2 to 4 inches between objects looks best.</p>
<h3 id="layer-your-illumination">7. Layer your illumination</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sV0RcBtC3EY01MF5divVMc4QP6U=/0x0:600x500/920x0/filters:focal%280x0:600x500%29:format%28webp%29:no_upscale%28%29/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19514473/08_foolproof_decor.jpg" alt="enter image description here"><br>
Each room should have three types of lighting: ambient, providing overall illumination and often coming from ceiling fixtures; task, often found over a kitchen island or a reading nook; and accent, which is more decorative, highlighting, say, artwork.<br>
You should be provided at least 3 watts (42 lumens) per square foot for a living room. Breining swears by one visual trick: use the uplights. “Placing a canister uplight in the corner or a torchiere will cast a glow on the ceiling, making a room appear larger,” he says.</p>
<h3 id="anchor-rugs-under-feet-of-furniture">8. Anchor Rugs Under Feet of Furniture</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wgUGjKIe7o5zBTjT_alnAI1ykdQ=/0x0:500x600/920x0/filters:focal%280x0:500x600%29:format%28webp%29:no_upscale%28%29/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19514503/09_foolproof_decor.jpg" alt="enter image description here"><br>
Follow these basic rules for an area rug: “In a living room, it should fit all four legs of a sofa and chairs in a group of furniture; the seating area should be defined by the rug,” Breining states. “The sofa and chairs at the front two legs should at least rest on it,” he adds.<br>
Also living rooms with a smaller proportion typically need an 8-by-10-foot or a 9-by-12-foot rug to suit a seating area properly. Go too small with the size of the rug and it all looks out of proportion.</p>
<h3 id="call-a-declutter-pro">9. Call a Declutter Pro</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GnF0bVXEZcMOq5gNyh5i1DufdXs=/0x0:600x400/920x0/filters:focal%280x0:600x400%29:format%28webp%29:no_upscale%28%29/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19514533/18_reader_built_in_0.jpg" alt="enter image description here"><br>
The longer you stay in a home, the less time you get to see the mess. Often you need a pair of fresh eyes. You can hire an organizer to tackle bookshelves and wardrobes for a few hours (expect paying $35 to $150 an hour depending on where you live), which stagers often say are packed with twice the amount of stuff they should hold.<br>
Breining recommends whiting down 50 per cent of what’s on the shelves. Then mix horizontal stacks of books between the vertical rows and intersect with decorative objects, such as bowls or vases.</p>
<h3 id="to-lift-the-roof-using-visual-tricks">10. To lift the roof, using visual tricks</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TpAmERwIfld1pA7wgC0FHdqKKNc=/0x0:400x600/920x0/filters:focal%280x0:400x600%29:format%28webp%29:no_upscale%28%29/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19514550/11_foolproof_decor.jpg" alt="enter image description here"><br>
To make the room feel less claustrophobic, paint them white if your ceilings are on the low side. Allen-Brett recommends hanging curtains higher than the windows to trick the mind into believing the room is larger. Most regular curtain panels measure 84 or 96 inches, so you can go about 3 inches above the case of the window until the length is too short.<br>
You’ll have to order custom drapes if you want to hang them up higher. Panels patterned with love? Seek vertical stripes; the lines make your walls visually elongated. Lean against a wall with a large mirror may also make a space look bigger.</p>
<h3 id="give-old-finish-treatment-for-cinderella">11. Give Old Finish Treatment for Cinderella</h3>
<p><img src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ggOkELFU0R3h5Q5Lrn7RhhDGcqM=/0x0:600x500/920x0/filters:focal%280x0:600x500%29:format%28webp%29:no_upscale%28%29/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19514585/03_open_cook_0.jpg" alt="enter image description here"><br>
Dated matches, have you? We are reinvented with spray paint and inexpensive refinish kits. “With a simple coat of hammered-bronze or satin-nickel spray paint, a brass chandelier from the 1980s will achieve a new lease on life,” says Breining.<br>
Even out-of-date kitchen cabinets benefit from a few white paint coats and new hardware. And if you thought Formica countertops didn’t have any chance, then think again. Breining swears by Rust-Oleum Countertop Transformations, a DIY counter-coating product that imitates stone, making even the ugliest counterpart of the 1970s look fresh.<br>
What needs to be done: Switch out broken and poorly fit switch plates and outlet covers to match new ones. Lynne says: “Nothing drags the refreshed room down like a dingy, almond-colored switch plate.”</p>
